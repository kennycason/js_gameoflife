=================
This is where I will house various Life simulations in Javascript/HTML5

The first will include a simple "Box Wars" simulation where boxes fight to live and reproduce

Boxes, 2 boxes reproduce on collision, then die. <br/>
Size is based on HP, lose HP when collide with wall. <br/>
Children stats are based on parents. <br/>
